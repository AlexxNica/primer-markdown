# GitHub User Content Stylesheets

* Stylesheet for rendering GitHub Flavored Markdown.
* Stylesheet for highlighting code generated by pygments.



## Sass and CSS

The GitHub Flavored Markdown Stylesheet ships in two formats:

### CSS

* `user-content.css` — Compiled CSS file ready to drop into any environment. Contains both markdown and syntax stylesheets.
* `user-content.min.css` — Minified version of `user-content.css`

### SCSS

* `markdown.scss` — Source Sass file for rendering markdown
* `syntax-pygments.scss` — Source Sass file for code highlighting generated by pygments
* `user-content.scss` — `@imports` both of the above. If you import this file, you do not need to import the others.



## Local development

The stylesheets are written in Sass and compiled to regular CSS via [Gruntfile](Gruntfile.js). To compile on your own, you need Grunt and our project's dependencies installed.

1. Install `grunt-cli` globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
2. Navigate to the root `/user-content` directory, then run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Done! Now you can run `grunt` from the command line.

**Unfamiliar with `npm`? Don't have node installed?** That's a-okay. npm stands for [node packaged modules](http://npmjs.org/) and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js. [Download and install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) before proceeding.



## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, the this project is maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines.
